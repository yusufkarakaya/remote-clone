## Reflection

  - What did you set out to build?
  - Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?

#### Example:  

This was a 2 weeks project. It was a side project, I did this project for experiment.

I wanted to build React clone landing page project for learning and experiment.

Css side was challenged. I learned the layout structure.
